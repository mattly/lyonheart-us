I've recently found myself once again building an API gateway service --- a server which provides to consumers a cohesive, unified interface to a suite of specialized backend concerns. The first official client is a mobile app, and early in the project we decided [GraphQL][] seemed an ideal interface with the phone. No one on our team had practical experience with it, so we decided to make GraphQL an _eventual_ ideal.

[GraphQL]: https://graphql.org/

GraphQL provides a number of benefits to a service like the one I'm building. It forces you to think about your data entities and their relationships _up front_. It allows the API consumer expressive flexibility in deciding what it wants, without worrying overmuch about which resources are where.

The [GraphQL schema providing library I'm using in the server][Lacinia] provides tools to map nodes in the graph to _resolvers_ which are responsible for getting what's needed when it's needed without complication. I recently started migrating much of the gateway service's internals over to resolvers, and making the REST endpoints execute GraphQL under the hood. It's been such a great experience it's how I want to build any REST APIs in the future.

I setup an instance of [GraphiQL][] to demo the new API. But while working with the mobile team to transition from our ad-hoc REST endpoints to using the new technology, there's not a lot of resources to understand how to work with a GraphQL API aside from, _just use a library_. While that might be a good idea, the popular libraries tend to be quite heavyweight, solve problems not common to all implementations of GraphQL (including ours), and tend to be prescriptive about client-side state management.

If you just want to understand how to work with it there's not a lot of beginner-friendly info. The documentation can be a bit abstract at times, and often conflates the topics of providing, consuming, resolving and responding to GraphQL queries. GitHub [has a good guide][github-guide], but unless you're working with their API it's not apparent that their resource is a general one.

Let's get started by making some simple queries against GitHub's [extensive GraphQL API][github-api] and [API Explorer using GraphiQL][github-graphiql], let's make some simple queries. Any demo involving HTTP ought to provide examples using [curl][].

[curl]: https://curl.haxx.se/
[github-api]: https://developer.github.com/v4/
[github-graphiql]: https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/

First, [create a personal token for use on the command-line][github-auth]. In the examples below, this will be `$TOKEN`. I'll prettify the results a bit. Let's use GitHub's example query to see if it works:

[github-auth]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/

<CodeExample
  title="whoami"
  examples={[
    { file:props.siblings['1-whoami.http'] },
    { file:props.siblings['1-whoami.bash'] },
    { file:props.siblings['1-whoami.graphql'] },
  ]}
  defaultResult={{ file:props.siblings['1-whoami.json'] }}
/>

Indeed it did! A few things for your attention:

1. The query is a POST request with a JSON body. This is [standard][graphql-post] for GraphQL over HTTP. Don't argue about REST semantics here --- POST is for the query because it might be too large to fit in url query parameters.

2. The query is a string at the `query` field inside the request body. The API server will parse the string into the query structure.

3. The query body is not valid JSON. GraphQL queries are their own language and many editors can highlight them specially.

4. The data we wanted `[queryRoot viewer login]` is in the response body at the `data` key.

While that covers the basics, you really should know about variables, mutations, and errors.
