# What I'm Up to [Now](https://nownownow.com/about)

_updated March 5th, 2021_

How are you? [Pandemic Fine](https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/trevis-gleason-life-with-multiple-sclerosis/pandemic-fine-how-many-of-us-are-feeling-in-2021/)? Me too.

It sometimes seems like a lot has changed while everything has stayed the same. Day in, day out, it often feels like [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)), though the background currents of a turbulent society and life with a small child remind us it's not.

I've started working on music again, and [finished a track](https://soundcloud.com/matthewlyonheart/coil-patch). I've got a few more in the works on a similar style, and hope to finally put together a short album this year.

I've changed up my workflow quite a bit for making music recently in some ways that really _work_ for me:

**First, I moved from [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) to [Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/)**. Live is great for what it is, but for me it's focus on making clips makes it harder to focus on constructing a narrative. While I miss [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/), Bitwig just feels more _immediate_: the layout for adding and routing tracks and devices is better, the built-in devices, and the modulation and automation systems are more accessible and composable, and I love that it lets you put inserts into the feedback loop of delays and the tank of reverbs. I've made a few [effect chains](https://user.fm/files/v2-b3623da6bc585926708404c9be0f4ea4/patches_mar_3.zip) to play around with.

**Second, I'm using dedicated hardware to give myself limitations, force myself to make decisions, and to work quickly**. I bought some actual hardware synthesizers and guitar pedals. The synths I don't like quite as much as what I have in the computer, but using the guitar pedals as insert effects from within Bitwig.

This means the in-process project on my computer depends on something outside of the computer to be connected and setup a certain way in order to have it sound right, which forces me to make decisions and record audio instead of having everything as midi and automation instructions that I can tweak later. It helps avoid analysis-paralysis. Additionally, because I have to turn things off at night (and have to reset some things like tempo and whatnot) and have a four-year-old who could come tweak the knobs at some point (they  know they're not supposed to, but...) that external process the computer relies on is also ephemeral.

In addition to the computer being unable to save the state of these devices, it's also unable to turn the knobs, so for parts that require some knob-tweaking (as this track has), I have to play the knobs while the computer is recording, and if I mess up, I have to put the knobs back where  they were and try again.

Overall, adding this to my workflow has given me a sense of urgency, because I know that if I don't get the idea out and down quickly, it'll be lost. It seems to have gotten me out of the habit of starting half a dozen ideas and letting them linger only to fizzle.

**Third, I'm performing everything instead of clicking**. This is a self-imposed limitation, designed to both help me get better at performing and again to short-circuit my sense of perfectionism. Is this take good enough, or should I try again?

Anyway, I'm excited about this, and it's really helping with my sense of creative fulfilment.
