# What I'm Up to [Now](https://nownownow.com/about)

_updated Nov 3rd, 2020_

I last wrote here in May, and once again the world is a different place. What is there to say about last five months, on the day of the most consequential election of my life?

It is weird to think that, 12 hours from now, I might have a completely different take on this time.

To start with, my partner and I are celebrating eight years of marraige today, and I'm happy as ever to be with her. If anything, I think the pandemic has helped us appreciate how we complement each other. The pandemic has put a new kind of stress on parents -- it takes a village to raise a child -- and our villages are now either smaller or virtual, and the slack is taken up by the parents; mostly her. We're lucky to have the resources we do, and have been doing what we can to help those in our community who are less fortunate, or to empower those who can work for better policies. I can only hope it's enough.

And there I go again, bringing it back to the election. It occupies everything.

I've been spending a good amount of time volunteering in a [local shoreline forest](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=west+bay+woods&atb=v226-1&ia=web) helping with ecosystem restoration, largely by pulling ivy. It's good excersize, feels productive, and spending time in the forest is good for my mind.
