I gave this talk at [Write the Docs North America 2014](http://conf.writethedocs.org/na/2014/). The  transcription on this webpage is free of my stuttering and the ideas are articulated better. If you'd prefer to watch me hem and haw, you're welcome to watch the [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEZcodengwk) instead.

Hi! I also answer to "mattly" in person. I'm a developer, I have built and launched a few products now, and I led the development of the most recent one of those. I want to talk to you today about what I think the role of documentation in product development is, and I hope to provide you with some tools for getting involved earlier in the development process.
